**GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

for Bullet Camp Children’s Camps**

Payment must be made through the platform sportsnow.ch. Registration is binding. If you no longer wish to participate in the camp, please contact us immediately at: info@bullet-trainer.com

Registration

Registration for children’s camps must be completed by a parent or legal guardian. After we receive your registration, you will receive written confirmation and an invoice for the participation fee by email. If you do not receive confirmation automatically, please contact the administration at info@bullet-trainer.com
.
Participation in the program is not guaranteed without proof of registration.

Registration is no longer possible after the registration deadline has passed. Registration is valid only for the entire camp week. There is no discount for days of absence (exception: withdrawal due to illness or accident with a medical certificate).

Pre-care, post-care or full-day care can be booked for the whole week until the registration deadline. Individual care modules can only be booked on-site at the camp, provided that the service is offered. Reserved but unused care modules are non-refundable.

Every submitted registration is binding, even if — for any reason — the confirmation email is not found in the inbox.

Participation Fees and Payment Confirmation

Participation fees apply to all children’s camps; they are listed in the registration form. These fees must be paid before the start of the event. Failure to pay the fee in advance may result in loss of the right to participate; in such a case, the payment obligation is governed by the section below.

Cancellations

Regarding cancellations for children’s camps:

Up to 3 weeks before the start of the camp, the amount will be refunded in the form of a voucher for another selected camp week.
No refunds will be issued within 3 weeks before the start of the camp. In case of illness or accident (with a medical certificate), the amount will be refunded in the form of a voucher.

If a participant misses individual camp days due to illness or accident, the daily fee for the missed day will be refunded in the form of a voucher upon presentation of a medical certificate.

If no written cancellation is submitted (e.g., simply not showing up), the full course fee will be charged.
Cancellations are accepted only by email at info@bullet-trainer.com

Cancellation by Bullet-Camps

The program will take place only if the minimum number of participants is met. Bullet-Camps reserves the right to cancel the program at any time, with a full refund of the participation fee. Additional childcare hours will only be offered if at least three children participate in the program.

Liability in Case of Accident / Illness / Property Damage

Insurance coverage is the responsibility of the participants. Bullet-Camps accepts no liability for accidents, illnesses, or property damage incurred by participants.

Liability in Case of Theft or Loss

The Bullet-Camps association accepts no liability for theft or loss of valuables or cash.

Health Information

By registering, participants confirm that they are healthy, fully able to engage in sports, and can complete the training program without limitations. Participants take part in the training at their own risk. Allergies, medications, and disabilities must be reported in writing to Bullet-Camps and the camp management before the start of the event.

Conduct

Participants must follow the instructions of the coaches. In cases of repeated failure to follow instructions, the coaches reserve the right to exclude participants from training or the program. In such cases, no refund of the participation fee will be granted.

Rights to Photos/Data and Videos

By registering, participants and their legal guardians consent to the creation of images and video recordings (data) of the participants. These may be distributed, publicly displayed (including online), and used by Bullet-Camps for its own advertising purposes.

Severability

If any provision of these Terms and Conditions becomes invalid, it shall be replaced by a provision that most closely reflects the intended economic purpose. All remaining provisions shall remain fully valid.
